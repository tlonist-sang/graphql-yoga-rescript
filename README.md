# Basic Reason Template

Hello! This project uses ReScript to build a graphql-yoga server with Prisma. This is a trial rough binding,

# Build

```bash
# for npm
npm run build
```
# Generate Prisma
```bash
# from /Prisma
npx prisma generate
```

# Build + Watch

```bash
# for npm 'watch' mode
npm run start

# execute src file
node src/index.bs.js
```
